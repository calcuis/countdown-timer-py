## Countdown Timer

This Python code uses the tkinter library to create a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for a countdown timer. The timer allows the user to set the countdown time in minutes and seconds and then starts a countdown until the time reaches zero. When the countdown reaches zero, a message box is displayed to notify the user that the time is up.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

Importing necessary modules:
- `from tkinter import *` imports all the classes and functions from the `tkinter` module.
- `from tkinter import messagebox` imports the `messagebox` class from the `tkinter` module.
- `import time` imports the `time` module for time-related operations.

Creating the main application window:
- `root = Tk()` creates the main application window.
- `root.title('Timer')` sets the title of the window to "Timer".
- `root.geometry('700x300')` sets the dimensions of the window to 700 pixels in width and 300 pixels in height.

Creating and configuring Entry widgets for minutes and seconds:
- Two Entry widgets are created to input the minutes and seconds for the countdown timer.
- sec and mins are `StringVar` variables that store the values entered by the user and are linked to the respective Entry widgets.
- The default values for the minutes and seconds Entry widgets are set to '00'.

Definition of `countdowntimer()` function:
- This function is responsible for starting the countdown timer.
- It calculates the total time in seconds based on the input minutes and seconds, then runs a loop to update the countdown every second.
- The countdown is displayed on the GUI and updates every second using `root.update()`.
- When the countdown reaches zero, a message box is displayed to indicate that the time is up.

Creating labels and buttons:
- A label is created to display "Set the Timer" on the GUI.
- A button labeled "START" is created, which triggers the `countdowntimer()` function when clicked.

Main event loop:
- `root.mainloop()` starts the main event loop, allowing the GUI to run and respond to user interactions.

Overall, the code creates a GUI with a simple countdown timer that allows the user to set a time and start the countdown. The timer updates every second until the time is up, at which point a message box is displayed.
